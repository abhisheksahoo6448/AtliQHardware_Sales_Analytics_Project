# AtliQHardware_Sales_Analytics_Project
The objective of this project is to analyze Customer Performance and Market Performance for a time period of 3 Fiscal Years (2019-21).
For my first objective I have created a pivot table which shows Net Sales customer-wise for 3 FY and net sales growth from 2020-21.
For my second objective I have shown net sales market(Country-wise) and compared it with the target sales.
I have also shown Profit and Loss Statement of the company by creating important metrics like Net Sales, COGS, Gross Margin and Gross Margin %.
